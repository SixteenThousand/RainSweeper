		<h1>Welcome to RainSweeper!</h1>
		<p> Ever played minesweeper and thought "I like this, but there's just 
		too many damn squares in this game! Also, it's not weather themed!"? 
		No? Well, either way, this problem has a solution: RainSweeper! At the 
		moment, the RainSweeper site has several modes, including, but not 
		limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Squares & Octagons!</li>
				<li>Hexagons!</li>
				<li>Triangles!</li>
				<li>Hexagons <i>and</i> triangles!!</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>
		Imagine: you just got your dream job, working for the met office, 
		but oh no! You just accidentally rm -rf'ed the whole database! Now 
		there's a huge group of clouds headed straight for the UK, and no-one 
		knows which of them are rainclouds and which are not! Looks like the 
		only way out for you is to guess which clouds are rainclouds. 
		Thankfully, these clouds follow a nice pattern: if you guess that a 
		cloud is not a raincloud and are right, that cloud will show you how 
		many of the clouds next to it are rainclouds! You have a chance!
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Clouds are neighbours if they <u>share any corners in common</u>, so in 
		the two examples below, the square with the gold star has 4 neighbours, 
		while the triangle with the gold star has 12!
		</p>
		
		<span>
			<img height="200" src="./assets/SqOctExample.svg" 
				alt="Square & 4 octagons"/>
			<img height="200" src="./assets/TriangleExample.svg" 
				alt="Triangles"/>
		</span>
		
		<p> Controls:
			<ul>
				<li>right-click a cloud to flag it as a raincloud</li>
				<li>left-click a cloud to reveal whether it is a raincloud or 
					not</li>
			</ul>
			If you do reveal a raincloud, don't worry! The met office is often 
			wrong anyway! Just try to <u>reveal as few rainclouds as possible
			</u>.
